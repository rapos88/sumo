# Evaluation Data for SuMo: A Supportive Modeling Language Environment for Guided Model Transformations

This evaluation data-set is broken into two experiments, corresponding to the two evaluation sections in 
the paper. Each experiment is contained within its own folder, which are described in the following sections:

- code-gen-experiment
- model-transform-experiment

## Experiment 1: Code Generation Evaluation

The code-gen-experiment folder follows the structure below:
```
+-- clean.sh
+-- run.sh
+-- TestCaseName
| +-- src
|   |+-- ...
| +-- Expected.txt
| +-- {ModelName}.iml
+-- ...
```
The `clean.sh` script is used to clean the directory of files created in evaluation. The `run.sh` script runs
the evaluation experiment printing results to the console, and also creating an Actual.txt result file that is stored
in the folder for each test (see below).

The remainder of the folder is a series of folders, one for each test case. Within each folder there is a `src`
folder than contains the code generated by the code generators, the original model file (the `.iml` file), 
and the expected output of running the generated code. This is where the actual result of running the code will be
stored after running the evaluation script (until the clean script is run).
